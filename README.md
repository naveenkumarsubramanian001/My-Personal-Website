# 🌐 Naveen Kumar's Portfolio

This is a **personal portfolio website** designed, prompted, and developed with the help of **ChatGPT**. It showcases my journey, projects, skills, certifications, and contact form — all styled with a Zoro-inspired dark aesthetic.

Hosted using **GitHub Pages**, this site reflects both my technical abilities and creative interests in tech, anime, filmmaking, and volunteering.

## 🚀 How to Deploy (Using GitHub Pages)

> ✅ If you're already editing directly in GitHub, you only need to enable GitHub Pages.

### 1. Clone or Fork this Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-portfolio-repo.git
cd your-portfolio-repo
```

### 2. Customize

- Replace all text content in `index.html` as needed.
- Add or replace images in the `assets/` folder.
- Update links like GitHub, LinkedIn, Drive, etc.
- If using a favicon, make sure it's added and linked in the `<head>`.

### 3. Enable GitHub Pages

- Go to your repo on GitHub  
- Navigate to **Settings → Pages**  
- Select the branch: `main` and folder: `/root`  
- Click **Save**  
- Your site will be live at:  
  `https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name`

## 💬 How the Contact Form Works

- The form in the Contact section uses [Formspree](https://formspree.io) to handle submissions.  
- Form action used:

```html
<form action="https://formspree.io/f/mnnvbvgz" method="POST">
```

- JavaScript handles:
  - Preventing the default form action  
  - Sending the form via `fetch()`  
  - Showing a temporary "Thank you" popup  

Make sure to verify your Formspree account if you change the endpoint.
